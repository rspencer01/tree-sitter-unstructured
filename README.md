# `tree-sitter-unstructued`

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-unmaintained-important)

This is a grammar for tree-sitter which aims to match any file and constructs
an AST with exactly one node - the root node. This node should span the entire
file.


### 🗃️ Project status 🗃️
This project has been soft-archived. It is unlikely to need further development,
and the project that initiated it no longer requires it as a dependency.
You are welcome to raise [issues](https://github.com/rspencer01/tree-sitter-unstructured/issues),
but I do not guarantee they will be addressed.  In particular, this will not
be updated to later versions of tree sitter, unless a PR to that effect is contributed.
